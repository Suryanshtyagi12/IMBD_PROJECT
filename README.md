Project: Exploring the Top 100 Rated Movies of the Past Decade

This project uses Python to analyze data about the top 100 rated movies from the past decade. The data includes information about the movies themselves, their actors, and the voters who rated them. By examining this data, we can gain insights into what makes a movie successful and how different factors like budget, genre, and actor popularity can influence a movie's performance.

Tasks:

Reading the Data:

Read the CSV file containing the movie data into a pandas dataframe.
Inspect the dataframe to understand its dimensions, data types, and presence of null values.
Data Analysis:

Reduce those Digits!: Convert the values in the 'budget' and 'gross' columns from dollars to millions of dollars for better readability.
Let's Talk Profit!:
Create a new column named 'profit' that represents the difference between 'gross' and 'budget'.
Identify the top 10 most profitable movies.
Visualize the relationship between 'budget' and 'profit' using a scatter plot. Analyze the plot to identify any patterns or trends.
Find the movies with negative profit and explore possible reasons behind these losses. High budget movies don't necessarily translate to high profits, and some factors that can contribute to losses include high production costs, expensive marketing campaigns, and disappointing box office performance.
